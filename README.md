# gravityFlowField
Creates nodes, a perlin noise vector field, and particles at the nodes. Particles experience negative attraction from their starting node and on initialization create a random list of nodes they are attracted to. Additionally to the gravity of the nodes, the particels experience force from the vector filed. Nodes can get added with mouseclicks and
