# gravityFlowField
Creates nodes, a perlin noise vector field, and particles at the nodes. Particles experience negative attraction from their starting node and on initialization create a random list of nodes they are attracted to. Additionally to the gravity of the nodes, the particels experience force from the vector filed. Nodes can get added with mouseclicks and pressing "i" starts the particle simulation. Pressing "s" saves the current screen as a vector graphic. This project uses the openFrameworks graphics stuff for displaying and managing the objects.

I used this to generate the cover of my thesis:
